			<h2>1. Overview</h2>
			<p>
				Mdit is built with a privacy-first, local-first approach. This policy
				explains how information is handled when you use the Mdit desktop app
				and website.
			</p>

			<h2>2. Information we collect and process</h2>
			<p>
				We do not require account registration to use Mdit. By default, your
				note content is intended to stay on your device, and we do not operate a
				hosted note-storage service for your notes.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you activate, validate, or deactivate a paid license, we process
				the license key and activation identifier. We also send limited client
				metadata used by the licensing flow, including platform and user agent.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you submit feedback from the app, we process the feedback message and
				any optional email address or screenshot you provide.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you choose to send an in-app error report, we process report details
				such as timestamp, app version, platform, user agent, error message,
				stack trace, and component stack.
			</p>
			<p>
				The desktop app may contact the update delivery endpoint (GitHub
				Releases) to check for and download app updates.
			</p>
			<p>
				We do not use analytics or telemetry in the app to track your writing
				behavior. Infrastructure providers for website operations may process
				limited technical logs needed for security and delivery.
			</p>

			<h2>3. How we use information</h2>
			<p>
				We use limited processed information to operate, secure, and
				troubleshoot Mdit, to verify paid-license access, to process feedback
				and error reports you submit, and to support update delivery.
			</p>

			<h2>4. When data may leave your device</h2>
			<p>By default, your note content remains local on your device.</p>
			<p>
				Data may leave your device when you use features that require external
				services, such as license activation or validation, feedback or error
				reporting, AI provider integrations, or Git sync.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you use AI features with a provider you select, prompts and related
				context may be sent to that provider under that provider's terms and
				privacy policy.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you enable Git sync, note files and commit history may be pushed to
				the remote repository you configure.
			</p>

			<h2>5. Sharing of information</h2>
			<p>
				We do not sell personal information. We do not share note content from a
				hosted Mdit note server because we do not operate one.
			</p>
			<p>
				Depending on the features you use, information may be processed by: our
				licensing provider (Polar), the operator of the configured feedback or
				error-report endpoint, GitHub Releases for update delivery, and
				third-party AI or sync providers you choose to connect.
			</p>

			<h2>6. Data retention and your control</h2>
			<p>
				Because note data is stored locally by default, you control retention by
				managing files on your device and your own backups. If you remove local
				files, that data is no longer available in Mdit unless you restore it
				from your backup.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the desktop app, the license key is stored in your system keyring,
				and the activation identifier is stored in local app storage.
			</p>
			<p>
				For information processed by external services (such as licensing,
				updates, feedback, or AI/sync providers), retention is limited to what
				is needed for operational, support, security, and legal purposes and is
				also subject to each provider's policies.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can request access or deletion for data we control by contacting
				<a href="mailto:contact@mdit.app">contact@mdit.app</a>
				.
			</p>

			<h2>7. Third-party services</h2>
			<p>
				Mdit may link to or interoperate with third-party services. Their
				privacy practices, terms, and data handling are governed by their own
				policies.
			</p>

			<h2>8. Changes to this policy</h2>
			<p>
				We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes are
				effective when published on this page.
			</p>

			<h2>9. Contact</h2>

				requests), contact us at
