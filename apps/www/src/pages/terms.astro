			<h2>1. Acceptance of terms</h2>
			<p>
				By using Mdit software or website, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do
				not agree, do not use Mdit.
			</p>

			<h2>2. What Mdit service includes</h2>
			<p>
				Mdit includes the desktop app, the official website, and paid features unlocked by a
				valid license key. Mdit is local-first: your note content is primarily stored on
				your device, and we do not operate a hosted note-storage service for your notes. If
				you connect third-party licensing, AI, or sync providers, their terms, pricing, and
				availability are governed by those providers.
			</p>

			<h2>3. Use of Mdit</h2>
			<p>
				You may use Mdit only in compliance with applicable laws. You are responsible for
				how you use the software and for the content you create or store.
			</p>

			<h2>4. Paid features and license key</h2>
			<p>
				Some features require a paid license key. To access those features, you must provide
				a valid key and keep it valid under the applicable purchase terms. License
				activation and periodic validation may require an internet connection.
			</p>
			<p>
				License usage is subject to activation and validation limits set by the licensing
				system. If a key is invalid, revoked, expired, or exceeds allowed usage, paid
				features may be limited or unavailable.
			</p>

			<h2>5. Refund policy</h2>
			<p>
				We offer a 14-day money-back guarantee for lifetime license purchases. Refund
				requests made after 14 days from the purchase date may be declined, unless otherwise
				required by applicable law.
			</p>

			<h2>6. Your data and backups</h2>
			<p>
				Mdit is designed for local-first usage, and note data is primarily stored on your
				device. You are responsible for maintaining your own backups and device security.
			</p>

			<h2>7. Open-source components</h2>
			<p>
				Mdit may include open-source software and is distributed under applicable license
				terms. See the repository for license details:
				<a
					href={`${GITHUB_REPO_URL}/blob/main/LICENSE`}
					target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer"
				>
					LICENSE
				</a>
				.
			</p>

			<h2>8. Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
			<p>
				Mdit is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, to the
				maximum extent permitted by law.
			</p>

			<h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
			<p>
				To the maximum extent permitted by law, Mdit and its maintainers are not liable for
				any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for any
				loss of data, profits, or business interruption.
			</p>

			<h2>10. Third-party links</h2>
			<p>
				The website may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for
				their content, policies, or practices.
			</p>

			<h2>11. Changes to these terms</h2>
			<p>
				We may update these terms from time to time. Updated terms are effective when
				published on this page.
			</p>
